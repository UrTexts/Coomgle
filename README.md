# Coomgle
Coomgle is one of the search engines of all time
# Set-up 
you will need to set up a google API key and then get a custom search engine ID, dont forget the imports. :)
# Usage
run `python coomgle.py`
You will get an output of its ip.
# Next Steps 
I'm not sure what else to do for this, feel free to add on to this, as of now i just used this project to learn more about API usage.
